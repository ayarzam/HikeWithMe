# HikeWithMe

Hike With Me is a mobile app that allows the user the ability to map the distance and area that they hike.

It is an ongoing project started during Grace Hopper's 2 day stackathon. 

I used Reac Native, React Native Maps, Firebase and the Firestore

Some challenges faced while working on this project include the integration of maps. I attempted to use google maps but encountered some problems due to problems using xcode not limited to the need to write in swift which is a language that I have no experience with yet. To have at least a partially working map by the deadline I decided to use React Native maps with plans to come back and attempt to change it to google maps later. 

Future direction for this project include the ability to save a hike, the ability for the user to navigate all of their hiking logs, creating and building out a message board that allows the user to communicate and connect with friends.
